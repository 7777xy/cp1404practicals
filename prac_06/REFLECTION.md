# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I keep doing some extra self-practices about coding based on my personal reflection.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think I need to improve the speed of coding and the reason why I will spend much more time doing assignment is because
of a not solid foundation. So I also need to make my foundation become solid.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I always preview the ppt about the class before attending to the class.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I think I need to watch the lesson video more frequently and more carefully in order to make a better preparation and 
have a solid foundation.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think the time of lecture should be extended.
