## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

time: before attending to the class.
location: home.
duration: it depends on the duration of the videos.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think is the previewing. Before attending to the class, I always preview the ppt.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I think the thing that I need to change is to be patient and cautious when coding.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I currently do poorly in the aspect of reviewing. I always make some mistakes that I have made before and I think 
this is because I do not try my best to memorize these mistakes.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I do really well in the aspect of spending lots of time on studying python and previewing the ppt in time.
